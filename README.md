- Open CMD
- Go to the directory where you placed this (e.g "cd desktop" and then "cd spelling" <-- Folder name)
- Open a new CMD and paste "pip install -r requirements.txt"
- Run the program


--Stuff--
- If using multiple links it will ask to save the .txt 1 time, close and then open another save .txt with the other results.
- This is minimum effort and i'm not sure if there's any bugs or whatever.
- It also displays the price and the names as a spelling mistake e.g "Asus" will be a spelling mistake
- If there's anything you want added, let me know 
- If you want to change anything then go for it, no need for credits or anything. (Doubt this'll be used for much else though)
- You obviously need python for this program to run
